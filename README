DONE:
 * The UI should be quite similar to the one provided:
      - two buttons in a button group to pick the orientation of the
        focused area (horizontal or vertical)
      - A slider, to pick the size of the focused area (which should
        take all the available space in the other orientation, and
        just the selected one in the other)
      - Receive a mouse event on the screen to pick the center of the
        focused area
 * The debian packaging is already working: plugins (Gallery and Quill) get
   installed to the right place, and later show in the Edit Options menu.
 * Gallery and Quill are connected, and the parameters are received.

TODO:
 * Adapt the already existing Gaussian Blur plugin so it can be used for
   this effect.
 * Provide a way either to chain calls to different plugins (so we can call
   the Gaussian Blur and later the color enhancement) or simply copy, paste
   and adapt the code from the various plugins.
 * Provide some way to apply the blurring outside a given area / merge the
   original image with the blurred one in order to keep an area focused.
 * The Gaussian Blur algorithm is known to be slow: maybe it will need some
   performance enhancements.
 * CSS styling and other tweaks for the UI
