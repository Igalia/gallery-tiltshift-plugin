USAGE:
 * Select the orientation of the focus (horizontal / vertical). In that
   orientation, the focused area will take all available space
 * Select the radius of the focus: that will rule the size of the focused
   area in the other orientation
 * Tap on the screen to center the focus around the given point

TODO
 * The Gaussian Blur algorithm is known to be slow: it will need some
   performance enhancements, besides the use of scanLines to access pixels
 * The Gaussian Blur filter makes artifacts on the borders of the tiles

KNOWN ISSUES:
 * Input images are restricted to 512x512 in order to avoid the artifacts on
   the borders of the tiles.
